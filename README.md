# Created By # the-chicken-tenders 
Project Repository for  SunHacks'20
#Problem Statement:
Online Learning has revolutionized the way people learn today. Quite unlike the days when learning stopped ; stepping out of university, today there's an endless number of courses available on the intemet.. Yet one of the repercussions of online courses being so accessible is: Its adding to students dilemma on which courses to follow and which not to. Quite often, people who set out to master some domain, encounter this problem, where they're unable to decide which courses to take and which to drop. It is also possible they may get stuck in this infinite regress, from one course to another; and not grow at all. 
# Aim
Our project aims to solve the problem. We strongly believe every individual should have equal opportunity to learn and grow. 

# What is your project?
The Minerva Project acts as a community driven page to create and share roadmaps to become domain experts in the fastest manner possible.

# What does it do?
Our project gives access to all the users to create a roadmap consisting of a wide variety of courses. 
For instance someone interested in studying Deep Learning could create a roadmap like this:-
1. Python crash course

2. Deep Learning Specialization- deeplearning.ai (Coursera)
3. MIT Introduction to Deep Learning | 6.S191 ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njKP3FqW3Sk&list=PLtBw6njQRU-rwp5__7C0oIVt26ZgjG9NI ) 
4. How to read research papers

5. Repository for deep Learning papers

6. Latest developments https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VH1Lim8gL8&list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf
7. Tensorflow tutorials

Since this is a complete community-driven project, the best roadmaps are going to have good ratings.
Users can either create their own roadmap or fork someone else's roadmap.

Each roadmap contains subtopics, a check list and a  description on how to get the best out of it.
Every roadmap can be starred (if user likes it) and forked (if user wants to follow it). 
Each user will have their own dashboard to see their progress, current projects and completed projects.

# How to access it?
Currently the project is divided into two sections frontend and sunhacks

If you want to see frontend => 
1. Browse inside frontend using terminal.
2. Write "npm install package.json" in the terminal
3. Write "npm start"
4. This will start a server in your local host.

If you want to see backend => 
1. Browse sunhack folder using terminal
2. Write "py -m pip install --user virtualenv" and then "py -m venv env" into terminal to create virtual environment
3. Write "env\Scripts\activate" to run virtual environment.
4. Write pip install -r requirements.txt
